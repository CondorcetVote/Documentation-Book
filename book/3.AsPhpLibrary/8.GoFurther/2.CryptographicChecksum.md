Powerful method to check the integrity after a wakeup action from serialized election or detect some changes (new votes, new computing data...) quickly between two states. 

```php
$originalChecksum = $election->getChecksum();
$toStore = serialize($election);
unset($election);
$newElection = unserialize($toStore);

$newElection->getChecksum() === $myChecksum; // True
```
