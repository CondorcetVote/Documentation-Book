# Create an Election

## Make a new Election
```php
use CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Election;

$myElection = new Election ();
```


## Get library version / Get object version

The distinction may be useful in before storing serialized version.

```php
Condorcet::getVersion();  // Return the Class engine version
$election->getCondorcetBuilderVersion(); // Return the Class engine version who build this object
```
