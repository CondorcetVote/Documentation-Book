# Create a new Vote Method

This section explains how to extend Condorcet by creating your own voting method.

You can implement a new voting method by following the interface and structure expected by the Condorcet engine. This allows you to integrate custom algorithms and use them as you would with built-in methods.

## Link your algorithm

Take inspiration from the simplified example below. Read code from ```CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Algo\Method``` (abstract class) and ```CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Algo\MethodInterface``` (interface).
You should also read ```CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Algo\Methods\Copeland``` code, it's a simple and efficient implementation.

## Basic example

<<< @/code_snippets/create_new_vote_method.php

You must register this algorithm this way:  

<<< @/code_snippets/register_new_vote_method.php
