# The workflow

## Election Cycle

### Classical Flow
1. **Add candidates**
_-- When you add your first vote, you will never be able to change the candidate list without starting a new election. --_
1. **Add votes** _Note that a same vote object can take part in multiple elections simultaneously._
1. **Get the results from one or multiple methods.** If you don't change the vote list, you can enjoy the cache engine. Else cache it's clear.

### Get the state
You can change votes at any time. The results cache will be flush _(but the results objects you get are still available and immutable)_ and the vote interpretation will be re-evaluated.

### Simple example
```php
use CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Election;

$myElection = new Election ();
```

::: tip Reference
[`Election->state`](/api-reference/Election%20Class/Election--state)
:::
```php
$election->state; // You don't need to set a state. This is informational.
```
