# Add Votes
_Note: You can add new votes after the results have already been given._

## Vote by vote
::: tip Reference
[`Election->addVote()`](/api-reference/Election%20Class/Election--addVote())
:::

### **With a string**
You can do the following:

<<< @/code_snippets/add_vote_string.php

*The last rank is optional, it will be automatically deduced.*

### **With an array**
<<< @/code_snippets/add_vote_array.php

*The last rank is optional, it will be automatically deduced.*

### **With Vote object**
You can also use Vote objects for more advanced usage:

<<< @/code_snippets/add_vote_objects.php

## Add multiple votes from string or text file

### **Native format**
Once your list of candidates has been previously recorded, you can parse a text file or a PHP string to record a large number of votes at once.

*You can combine this method with the traditional PHP calls above.*

#### Syntax
<<< @/code_snippets/votes.txt

::: tip Reference
[`Election->parseVotes()`](/api-reference/Election%20Class/Election--parseVotes())
:::

#### Method
<<< @/code_snippets/parse_votes.php

### **From Json**


#### Syntax
> In this example, all parameters are optional except vote.
> * 'multi' is used to record N times the vote.
> * 'tag' is used in the same way as addVote()
> * 'vote' is used in the same way as addVote()

::: tip Reference
[`Election->addVotesFromJson()`](/api-reference/Election%20Class/Election--addVotesFromJson())
:::


#### Method
<<< @/code_snippets/add_votes_from_json.php

### **Election files formats**
Look at the [**dedicated section**](/book/3.AsPhpLibrary/8.GoFurther/4.ElectionFilesFormats.md#election-files-formats).
