## Usual Use

<<< @/code_snippets/full_ranking_example.php

_This example is dangerous, becouse Schulze winner and Loser can return array, tie is possible ; this code doesn't bother with that.


## Results with with tags filter option

::: warning
Performances: Using `getResult()` with tags filter option doesn't use cache engine and computing each time you call it. Prefer to store the result object instead of call it multiple times.
