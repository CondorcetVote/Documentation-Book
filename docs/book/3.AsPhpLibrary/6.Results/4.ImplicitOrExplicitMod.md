# Ranking mode - Implicit versus Explicit

## Impact on an election results

By default, if you do not rank all candidates in a vote, all unranked candidates are implicitly considered last. 
Optionally, you can prefer to allow voters to not rank all candidates.

You can change this mode. It will reset all computed results and provide a new result, they can be different.
