# Vote Methods Options & Warning

## Methods Options
A method option allows you to adjust some parameters on the methods of voting proposes them. Most often, methods propose subclasses when possible, otherwise they are options, which we will explore. The option are documented for each method of the [voting methods documentation](/gh/VotingMethods). Options have alway a default value.  

A method option is set at the election object to ensure that the correct cache management tasks are performed. It is possible to set them statistically at the level of the algorithms, but this track will not be explored here.

::: tip Reference
[`Election->setMethodOption()`](/api-reference/Election%20Class/public%20Election--setMethodOption) 
:::
### Exemple with Borda
```php
$election->setMethodOption('Borda Count', 'Starting', 0);

// The result object keeps metadata about options passed in a readonly property
$election->getResult('Borda Count')->methodOptions; // ['Starting' => 0]
```

## Results Warning

### Kemeny-Young
Currently, Kemeny-Young is potentially subject to conflict leading to a relatively arbitrary final choice. Very likely thing in the case of a very small number of voters. The current implementation does not include any trick to the resolver.   
The next option allows you to get rather than ranking, information on the existence or the absence of these conflicts. The following example mounts how to you use it.   

::: tip Reference
[`Result->getWarning()`](/api-reference/Result%20Class/public%20Result--getWarning)
:::
```php
use \CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\Algo\Methods\KemenyYoung\KemenyYoung;

$result = $election->getResult( 'KemenyYoung' ) ;

if ( !empty($result->getWarning(KemenyYoung::CONFLICT_WARNING_CODE)) )
{
    $kemeny_conflicts = explode(';', $result->getWarning(KemenyYoung::CONFLICT_WARNING_CODE)[0]['msg']) ;

    echo 'Arbitrary results, Kemeny-Young has '.$kemeny_conflicts[0].' possible solutions at score '.$kemeny_conflicts[1];
}
else
{
	// $result is your habitual result ;
}
```
