# Timer benchmarking 
These two methods can be useful in estimating the computation time of each call to the algorithm. It is not a calculation of all operations carried out by the library, but those specifically related to modules of algorithms for calculating election results.

## Activate / Deactivate Timer
Internal use of the timer can be deactivated globally, it's the default. Can improve performances by a few tenths of a percent for the most demanding uses on the subject.  
You must activate it before doing something.
