# Objects mutability

If the Condorcet API is really very flexible and accepts many input formats.
Using its object mode allows the most advanced and elegant uses. It is possible to act on certain objects in the user space that are shared with the Condorcet engine, and to produce immediate and perfectly supported results.
The philosophy of Condorcet PHP is that everything is mutable, or almost, only the `Result` object shows some signs of partial immutability.
This can create debates, as voting is a sensitive procedure requiring strong integrity control. However, this mutability allows powerful manipulation/simulation tools. Achieving immutability in your implementation only requires not using the mutation methods and/or not storing in your user space the references of the objects passed to Condorcet (or letting him create them himself). The responsibility is therefore left to the implementation.
However, a history of the mutability of the Votes and Candidates objects is provided by the API, which does not forget anything, in order to establish a safety net. Just like the cryptographic checksum _(see dedicated section)_

## Overview
It should be noted that internally Condorcet only works with objects.
When another input method is used, it creates the objects itself, for the `Candidate` objects it tries to match them to pre-existing objects. Here is an example.
```php
use \CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\{Candidate, Election, Vote};

$election = new Election;

$candidateWagner = new Candidate('Wagner');
$election->addCandidate($candidateWagner) === $candidateWagner; // True
$candidateDebussy = $election->addCandidate('Debussy'); // Create and register the new Candidate('Debussy');

$vote = new Vote('Debussy > Wagner'); // Create from string, will internally create temporary Candidate object. This does not happen if you work directly with Candidate object.
$vote->getRanking()[1] === $candidateDebussy; // False, internally, it's using a temporary candidate object
$vote->getRanking()[2] === $candidateWagner; // False, internally, it's using a temporary candidate object


$election->addVote($vote);
$vote->getRanking()[1][0] === $candidateDebussy; // True, the temporary candidate is replaced by the real one.
$vote->getRanking()[2][0] === $candidateWagner; // True, the temporary candidate is replaced by the real one.

// The getHistory method log any change, including this automatic one.
count($vote->getHistory()); // 2
$vote->getHistory()[0]['timestamp'] < $vote->getHistory()[1]['timestamp']; // True
```

Keeping the previous example, look what happens if I change a candidate name.
```php
$candidateWagner->setName('Richard Wagner');
$candidateDebussy->setName('Claude Debussy');

$vote->getRanking()[1][0]->getName(); // 'Claude Debussy'
$vote->getRanking()[2][0]->getName(); // 'Richard Wagner'
```

Or the Ranking: The results of my election are modified instantly (only new results objects).
```php
$election->getResult()->getResultAsString(); // "Claude Debussy > Richard Wagner"
$vote->setRanking('Richard Wagner > Claude Debussy');
$election->getResult()->getResultAsString(); // Richard Wagner > "Claude Debussy"
$vote->getHistory(); // Every change is logued
```

## Multiples elections per objects
```php
use \CondorcetPHP\Condorcet\{Candidate, Election, Vote};

// Create objetcs
$candidateA = new Candidate('A');
$candidateB = new Candidate('B');
$candidateC = new Candidate('C');

$election1 = new Election;
$election1->allowsVoteWeight(true);

$election1->addCandidate($candidateA);
$election1->addCandidate($candidateB);
$election1->addCandidate($candidateC);

$election2 = clone $election1;

$voteUnique1 = new Vote([1 => $candidateA, 2=> $candidateB, 3 => $candidateC]);
$voteUnique2 = clone $voteUnique1;
$voteMix = clone $voteUnique1;

$voteMix->setWeight(2);
$voteUnique1->setWeight(3);
$voteUnique2->getWeight(); // 1

// register candidates + $voteMix in both elections
foreach([$election1, $election2] as $e) {
    $e->addVote($voteMix); // In both election
}

// Add other vote to their elections
$election1->addVote($voteUnique1);
$election2->addVote($voteUnique2);

// Count Links for Votes
$voteUnique1->countLinks(); // 1
$voteUnique1->getLinks()[0] === $election1; // True
$voteUnique2->countLinks(); // 1
$voteUnique2->getLinks()[0] === $election2; // True
$voteMix->countLinks(); // 2
$voteMix->getLinks()[0] === $election1; // True
$voteMix->getLinks()[1] === $election2; // True

// Count Links for Candidates
$candidateA->countLinks(); // 2
$candidateA->getLinks()[0] === $election1; // True
$candidateA->getLinks()[1] === $election2; // True

$election1->getWinner() === $election2->getWinner(); // True

$voteMix->setRanking([1 => $candidateB, 2=> $candidateC, 3 => $candidateA]);

$election1->getWinner() === $election2->getWinner(); // False
$election1->getWinner() === $candidateA; // True
$election2->getWinner() === $candidateB; // True
```

## Limitations
In the case of using an external data handler, used to manage up to billions of votes in an election, then the correspondence between your objects and those used internally by Condorcet, is no longer guaranteed, as these are destroyed during storage and then recreated. However, your objects in user space are properly unlinked from the election.
