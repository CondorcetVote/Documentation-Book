# The workflow

## Election Cycle

### Classical Flow
1. **Add candidates**
_-- When you add your first vote, you will never can change candidate list without starting a new election --_
1. **Add votes** _Note that a same vote object can take part in multiple elections simultaneously._
1. **Get the results from one or multiple methods.** If you don't change the vote list, you can enjoy the cache engine. Else cache it's clear.

### Get the state
You can change candidates or votes at any time. The results cache will be flush _(but the results objects you get are still available and immutable)_ and the vote interpretation will be re-evaluated.

?> [`Election->getState()`](/Docs/ApiReferences/Election%20Class/public%20Election--getState)
```php
$election->getState(); // You don't need to set a state. This is informational.
```
