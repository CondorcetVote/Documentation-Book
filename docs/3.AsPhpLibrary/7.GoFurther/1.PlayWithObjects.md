# Play with Election, Candidate & Vote objects

Condorcet PHP allow you to get some abstractions. All you inputs are objects : The Candidates and Votes object. An election is also an Election object.

You can get multiples Election, sharing fully ou partially the same Candidate and Votes object. Update one of them have repercussion on all elections.
Voting may also be incomplete, and thus participate in the elections with an alternative candidate list.

// II - Create Election

$myElection1 = new Election ();
$myElection2 = new Election ();

// III - Manage Candidate

    # -A- Add candidates

        // A string
        $myElection1->addCandidate('A');

        // An objet
        $myElection1->addCandidate( new Candidate ('Koechlin') );
        $myElection1->addCandidate( new Candidate ('Caplet') );
        $myElection1->addCandidate( new Candidate ('Debussy') );
        $myElection1->addCandidate( new Candidate ('Olivier Messiaen') );
        $myElection1->addCandidate( new Candidate ('Ligeti') );

        // Automatic name
        $myAutomaticCandidate = $myElection1->addCandidate();
        $myAutomaticCandidate->getName(); // Return 'C'

        // Follow this one
        $myLutoCandidate = new Candidate ('Lutoslawski');
        $myElection1->addCandidate( $myLutoCandidate );


    # -B- Change your mind ?

        $myElection1->removeCandidates('A');
        $myElection1->removeCandidates($myAutomaticCandidate);

        // Lutoslawski change his name
        $myLutoCandidate->setName('Wiltod Lutoslawski'); # Done !

            # What was his old names?
            $myLutoCandidate->getHistory(); // return the full history with timestamp of this Candidate naming


    # -C- Check your candidate list, if you forget it
        $myElection1->getCandidatesList(); // Return an array pupulate by each Candidate objet
        $myElection1->getCandidatesList(true); // Return an array pupulate by each Candidate name as String.

        // OK, I need my Debussy (want his candidate object)
        $myDebussyCandidate = $myElection1->getCandidateObjectFromName('Debussy');


// IV - Manage Votes

    # -A- Add Votes

        $VoteModel = [$myDebussyCandidate, 'Caplet', array('Olivier Messiaen', 'Ligeti'), 'Koechlin']; // Messiaen & Ligeti are at equallity. $myLutoCandidate is not here, but it will be automatically detect in $myElection1 objet a add at the last rank.

        for ($i = 0 ; $i < 95 ; $i++) {
            shuffle($VoteModel);
            $myElection1->addVote( $VoteModel );
        }

            // How Many Vote could I Have now ?
            $myElection1->countVotes(); // Return 95 (int)


        // More fun way to add Vote from full string input !
        $myVote96 = $myElection1->addVote('Debussy > Olivier Messiaen = Ligeti > Wiltod Lutoslawski');
        
        //Add some tags

                                            ['greatFrenchVote','strangeVote'] // You can also pu your tags for this vote
        );

        // Parse multiple Votes
        $myElection1->parseVotes("
            tag1,frenchies,tag3 || Olivier Messiaen > Debussy = Caplet > Ligeti # Tags at first, vote at second, separated by '||'
            Ligeti > Caplet # Line break to start a new vote. Tags are optionals.
            strangeVote,tag3 || Debussy=Koechlin= Ligeti = Wiltod Lutoslawski = Olivier Messiaen>Caplet * 11 # This vote and his tag will be register 11 times
        ");

        // Creating self Vote object
        $myVote111 = new Vote ( [$myDebussyCandidate, $myLutoCandidate, 'Caplet'], 'customeVoteTag,AnAnotherTag' );
        $myVote112 = new Vote ( 'Olivier Messiaen = Caplet > Wiltod Lutoslawski', ['customVoteTag','AnAnotherTag'] );

        $myElection1->addVote($myVote111);
        $myElection1->addVote($myVote112);


    # -B- Manage Votes

        # 1- Get vote list
            // Get the vote list
            $myElection1->getVotesList(); // Returns an array of all votes as object.

            // How many Vote with tag "strangeVote" ?
            $myElection1->countVotes('strangeVote'); // Return 12 (int)

            // Return this 12 votes !
            $myElection1->getVotesList('strangeVote');
            // Or without this tags and get the first of them
            $oneVoteToDelete = $myElection1->getVotesList('strangeVote', false)[0] ;

        # 2- Vote objet
            $myVote111->getRanking(); // Return the current ranking
            $myVote111->getContextualRanking($myElection1); // Return the full ranking in the context of election 1 (with 6 candidates)

            // Check the vote history
            $myVote111->getHistory();


        # 3- Delete Votes

            // Delete a specific vote object
            $myElection1->removeVote( $oneVoteToDelete );

            // Delete all vote with tag "strangeVote" or "frenchies"

            # $myElection1->removeVotesByTags( ['strangeVote','frenchies'], false ); // Here, if uncomment, all the vote will be deleted.


// V - Get Result

            // Natural Condorcet Winner
            $myElection1->getWinner(); // Return NULL if there is not, else return the winner candidate object
            $myElection1->getWinner('Schulze'); // Same thing, but try to resolve by Schulze method if there is not one. Can return an array of winners if there are multiple.

            // Natural Condorcet Loser
            $myElection1->getLoser(); // Return NULL if there is not, else return the winner candidate object

            // Advanced Method
            $myElection1->getResult(); // Result set for defaut method (Should be Schulze Winning)
            $myElection1->getResult('Copeland'); // Do it with the Copeland method

            // Get an easy game outcome to read and understand (Table populated by string)
            $easyResult = CondorcetUtil::format($myElection1->getResult());


// VI - Play with Condorcet objects (Advanced)

        // Create a second election
        $myElection2 = new Election ();

         // Create three candidate : 'A', 'B' and 'C'

        // Add it on election 1 and 2
        $myElection1->addVote( $myNewVote ); // Note that Vote has been altered. 'Debussy' string become a reference to $myElection1->getCandidateObjectFromName('Debussy'); Cause there are namesake and there was not any conflict.
